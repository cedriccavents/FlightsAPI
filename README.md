# Flights App

This is a basic App to test Dash in Python. 
The purpose of the App is to check and compare live flight prices (using a Skyscanner API) for up to 5 destinations chosen by the user. A free API-Key can be generated using Rapid-API: https://rapidapi.com/.
The basic plan gives 100 API calls for free per month. 

## Installation

To run the App: clone git locally, install all packages in requirements.txt and run app.py on localhost.
